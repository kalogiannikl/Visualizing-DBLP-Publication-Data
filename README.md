# Visualizing DBLP Publication Data

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes bibliographic data from the [DBLP Computer Science Bibliography](https://dblp.org/) for three selected authors: [Jure Leskovec](https://dblp.org/pid/l/JureLeskovec.html), [Christos Tjortjis](https://dblp.org/pid/55/5997.html), and [Philip S. Yu](https://dblp.org/pid/y/PhilipSYu.html).  
It highlights publication trends, collaboration patterns, and venue preferences using a variety of visualizations — including **bar plots**, **stacked bar plots**, **line plots**, and **pie charts**.  

The analysis is divided into **two sections**:  
1. **Individual Author Analysis** – exploring each author’s publication trends, co-authorship patterns, and preferred venues.  
2. **Combined Author Comparison** – comparing all three authors across different metrics to identify similarities and differences.
